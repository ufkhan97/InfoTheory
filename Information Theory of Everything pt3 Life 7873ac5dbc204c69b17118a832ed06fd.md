Biology: the study of life

Life is hard to define. It’s had various definitions over the years. Traditional science says life is that which maintains homeostasis and is able to replicate. 

Homeostasis is maintaining some internal state, like temperature, in response to external circumstances. For example, even if you walk outside into the cold you don’t turn into an ice block and die instantly. Instead, your body activates ways of keeping itself warm (like shivering or burning stored energy) so you maintain a steady internal temperature in the cold.

Replication, or reproduction, is often also seen as a key to living things. This is largely because we don’t see things that are not alive reproducing. A rock does not reproduce. Reproduction is seen as one of the things only life can do. Some organisms reproduce by creating perfect replicas. In humans, when we reproduce we pass some of our DNA onto our offspring.

DNA is the genetic code. It stores the information of how to build your body. It is a blueprint of you. Your blueprint is made of a mixture of your parents blueprints and a bit of randomness. 

Information is structure, it is about how things are arranged relative to one another. DNA has a structure of 4 types of molecules which create an alphabet. These 4 letters can be rearranged to create as much variety and complexity as our own language. 

Humans are alive because we maintain homeostasis and have DNA we pass onto our offspring to reproduce. 

A boat is not alive. Perhaps it can burn fuel in it’s engine to maintain some relative homeostasis and keep itself moving but it certainly can’t replicate. 

There is the old paradoxical myth of the Ship of Theseus. If you have a ship — a beautiful grand ship made of wooden panels, large timber, linen sails, twine rope — and you go on a dangerous voyage which requires you to replace parts of the ship as they gets damaged, then by the end of your voyage having replaced every single part of the ship you left from home with: is it still the same ship?

I would say it is. I would say that ship is even touching the boundaries of what it means to be alive. 

To me, a living being is that which survives time while maintaining parts that are changing and parts that aren’t. The ship of Theseus would have been dead if it fell apart, if it was destroyed, not if it’s parts were replaced with other parts. It is undoubtedly a different ship and yet also the same ship. This paradox is the paradox of life. 

What about replication? Replication, or reproduction, is just a way to survive in time. If your DNA passes onto the next generation then your DNA has survived. Your DNA stores the information of you, the structure of you. 

A living being has structures which survive time and structures which change. It is enough for the structures which survive time to survive from sequential moment to sequential moment — they do not even need to be the same static structure for the entirety of the beings “life.”

We have cells which make up our entire bodies yet we do not have the exact same cells throughout our life. In fact, from our birth to our death it is likely that every single cell in our body has been replaced many times over. Those parts have changed. Yet, we are still the same overall being, because we have maintained some part of our structure — the core of our structure — our blueprint. Our DNA. 

Our DNA outlives us. Our DNA will be alive in our children and grandchildren. In this way, the lifespan of our DNA will be longer than us. In fact, any living being can be said to be made of smaller living beings — tissues, cells, and DNA. DNA is deeply alive. Genes are information structures which have parts that remain static and parts that are dynamic. The static parts each maintain their own lifespan as long as they exist. 

Life is not, as I see it, something which only exists at the level of the organism. Life exists at the level of information, the level of structures, and changes through time.

Rampant Speculation: 

It is extremely unlikely that our DNA remains static throughout our life. Rather it takes on different forms in different cells.  And Certain sections are turned on or turned off. This forms an epigenome, a broadly varying class of genes. It is further likely that some components of personal memory are stored somewhere in DNA. DNA, plus enzymes, have the exact structure of a turing tape and would appear to allow for universal computation and information storage. It is unclear to me how information could be stored through time in neurons otherwise. How are electrical impulses maintained to allow for memory? Maybe idk enough about computers. But Perhaps the dna mixes with rna used for memory storage purposes. 64 3letter DNA sequences have traditionally been translated into 20 amino acids. It seems likely that 4, 5, 6 letter words can also be made. It seems likely that DNA can encode multiple types of information beyond just amino acids. There is probably some “key” sequence which lets the appropriate enzyme understand the encryption method
