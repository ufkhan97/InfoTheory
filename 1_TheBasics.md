# Information Theory of Everything pt1 The Basics

If you wanted to build a universe, how would you do it?

If you had to determine the legos our universe is built of then what do they seem to be?

This post covers some of the basics of Information Theory (as I see it). Will likely be a boring read to most. 

 

Most people might start the search for the universe’s building blocks by looking at atoms or molecules — they might say that through rearranging atoms into particular combinations then you give rise to the infinite complexity of our universe. 

Personally, I don’t like thinking in terms of atoms. There are so many on the periodic table and I can’t memorize them all. 

What is an atom, anyway? It’s just some energy which coalesced into a structure with enough stability to not spontaneously fall apart. There are various sizes the energy is stable in and these are the different elements of the periodic table. Atoms, of course, are made of even smaller particles which are even smaller energy structures that are stable. (And maybe it’s turtles all the way down :) )

So, what is an atom?

It’s some energy in a place. It interacts with other energy in other places. 

Let’s define an atom as: energy with position (just like a photon: potentially the tiniest piece of energy with position) 

This gives us some follow-up questions: 

What is Energy?

What is Position? 

**Energy** is the essential essence from which everything is made. It is a type of *magic jello*: it comes in different colors, sizes, and shapes. It can be light or dark (or whatever else), big or small, round or sharp. Energy comes in different structures: from quarks and photons to electrons, neutrons, atoms, molecules. The energy is simply gathering into different sized clumps and being rearranged to create increasingly complex structures. 

**Position** is how we can say some energy is to the left or right of some other energy and how far away it is. For example, if I have two legos and I place them side by side then I can say the position of one is next to the position of the other. If I place my legos on a graph then I may compare the position of both these legos to the origin on the graph: the (0,0) point. The important thing to notice about position is that *it’s all relative.* We can define the position of a lego only in terms of the positions of other legos or some 0,0 point of our choice. Without relating the position of something to the position of something else, it is *impossible* to define. We could more generally call position **relation.** (We’ll also take as a given that time can be described as a position or relation, just like space)

To summarize, here are our first two building blocks of the universe:

Energy: the essential essence from which everything is made

Position: the comparison/relation of energies to define their location (in spacetime) 

Let’s pause for a moment to consider the Big Bang: a moment in time (perhaps the origin of time) when energy which had all coalesced into a single structure burst apart into many pieces. These pieces spread throughout a space called the universe and rearranged into different structures like stars, planets, and galaxies. This image indicates that all energy originally was just one energy. When everything is one, there is no ability to distinguish between some thing and another thing — it is definitionally impossible because there is only one thing.

What happens when you have Energy and Position? 

When you have multiples energies with different positons, you can arrange those energies into different combinations — different structures. From this ability, emerges what we call ‘Information’. 

What is Information?

**Information** is structure. It is what emerges from energy with position. When we have multiple energies and we can arrange them into different structures then we can have information. 

What about bits and stuff?

Information is often *measured* in bits. A single bit is the amount of information which answers a yes/no, 0 or 1, this or that question. Bits are information encoded in binary. 

Information is really complicated. It’s hard to understand. One key thing to know about information is that it does not inherently mean anything. It’s just structure — some arrangement of energy, or letters, or numbers. To someone who does not speak the language which particular information is encoded in, that structure has no meaning. Meaning is inferred by the observer of the information if they believe they know what the encoding represents. If I hear someone say “it’s raining today” in english I can infer that means there is water falling from the sky. If someone said the same words in greek, I would have no idea what the heck they were talking about. 

Let’s turn back to the big bang and discuss entropy. Entropy, the other side of the information coin, is also called uncertainty. **Uncertainty** is proportional to the number of different states a system can be in. 

Prior to the big bang, the universe could only be in one state. All energy was collected into one indistinguishable whole. Entropy or uncertainty was zero. 

As the energy shattered, the entropy increased, and the number of possible states the universe could be in increased. Today, the universe continues to expand and an increasing number of states of the universe become possible. Entropy increases. 

We now have four building blocks of our universe. The first two: energy and position give rise to the next two: information and uncertainty. 

This idea that from simple parts (energy and position) can emerge complex behavior (information and uncertainty) is part of the study of complex systems. 

What can you create from these four blocks? I think you can make the entire universe and everything in it. I’ll explore that idea in future blog posts and engage in greater speculation.

**Note:** This is just my perspective, based on things I’ve read or thought about. I could be wrong but it’s *fun* for me to think about and I would love to know what others think. There is an incalculable debt owed to those whose ideas form this theory. I was inspired by the ideas of: Karl Friston, David Deutsch, Derek and Laura Cabrera, Claude Shannon, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Edgar Allen Poe, and many others. I also owe a debt to those who personally opened my eyes to the beauty and elegance of our universe: Mr. F, Mrs. B, Dr. T, Dr. S, and Dr. N (and more!)

This is speculation and from herein will get increasingly speculative. 

But first, there are a couple more ideas we need:

Dimensionality and Equivalence. 

What is dimensionality?

As I define it, dimensionality is that which contextualizes & relates a part to a whole. It is the context. A dimension is an axis, a frame of reference. By increasing the number of dimensions in a system, we increase the complexity of it. 

In a zero-dimensional system you have a single point or you don’t. 

In a one-dimensional system, an axis, your point can turn into a line which extends left or right. If your axis is circular, the tip of the line can come back to its own beginning. 

In a two-dimensional system, you have lines and waves which can grow in two directions (left-right and up-down)

What is equivalence?

Equivalence, as I definite it, is the idea that if two things are exactly the same then it is just one thing occupying two positions. A “thing” here means energy with a specific structure. Note that two separate instances of the same structure are not the same energy and not equivalent. 

Fuzzy Wires bro get with it

Alright so far we have: Energy, Position, Information, Uncertainty, Dimensionality, and Equivalence.

There is a seventh (and I believe final) component which is the hardest to understand for me: the Observer. 

The observer is the being which is gaining information and resolving uncertainty. The observer has a perspective. The observer’s perspective is defined by the position it occupies. The observer exists within, as a part of, the universe. Because of this: the observer has subjective information. Information which is from the perspective of that observer. From another perspective, another observer would have received different information and therefore have different uncertainty resolved and unresolved. These two observers therefore see the universe in different states. Are either of these states false or true? No, they are both subjective.

An objective observer, one with information which is true from every perspective could only exist outside the universe. They would be able to see the universe from every perspective and therefore have minimum uncertainty. 

Let’s talk about what all of these pieces do together. 

With Energy and Position we can create structures. An observer of the universe would not know what was the structure and universe unless that observer gained information about it. Because multiple structures are possible, we can have uncertainty. An observer of the universe who tries to determine the complete structure: try to know what is where would need to understand its dimensionality. That is: to know what is where you need to know along what dimensions you are asking the question. The more dimesnions you consider the more
