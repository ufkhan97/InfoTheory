distributed node computing, subjectivity of information, 

How does information and uncertainty work?
Is each node of energy seperated from other nodes of energy by a link of empty space? Is the link of empty space somehow connected to gravity which shortens and lengthens these links?

Is uncertainty to time as gravity is to space? 

What is a network?
What is a node?
How does distributed computing work? 

Are nodes interacting with nearby nodes to determine their certainty?
Where are the boundaries between nodes? Are there even real boundaries? There must be at some level for electrons and protons and neutrons to come together into an atom, there must be some boundaries between these components. But within an electron or within a photon the boundaries may be more blurry, or fuzzy.
