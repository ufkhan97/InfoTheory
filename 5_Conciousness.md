# Information Theory of Everything pt 5 Consciousness

Consciousness is a hard problem. It is often called ‘THE’ hard problem. It is a hard term to define. For many everyday people there is a loose feeling that it is what separates humans from other lifeforms on earth. It is some unique thing we possess. 

Some define consciousness as affect or feeling — the ability to feel pain or pleasure. Some define consciousness as awareness of self. Some define consciousness as linked to identity. And some define it yet differently, still.

Animals, like a dog, can certainly feel pain and pleasure. They appear to have awareness of self, at least as far as knowing when they need to eat, pee, or navigate their environment. 

Dogs then fit most definitions of conscious. They may be less self-aware than humans. They certainly don’t possess the high-level abilities of language to articulate the nature of their own existence to themselves. 

Humans uniquely of the animals on this planet have language. I think this is one of the key abilities which allows us to reach a higher level of consciousness. I think consciousness is a gradient. Some lifeforms are more conscious and some are less conscious. 

I would define consciousness as the ability to draw a boundary between oneself and the environment and to understand the mechanisms of one’s self and ones environment. This is deeply dependent on information processing.

In order for a being to distinguish between itself and its environment it must be able to process information about its environment. It must be able to know when something is outside of its “self” or inside of its “self”.  Pain and pleasure, when combined with information about location of the pain and pleasure provide some data points to help in drawing a boundary. So does sound or sight. It’s like connect the dots. But, this also requires categorization ability, like AI drawing bounding boxes or contours with a label. Being able to contour the “self” is probably the minimum requirement to become conscious. 

Next, the being must know how itself works — it must understand the machine within which its information is processed. The better this understanding, the more conscious the being may be. 

I should note that I think consciousness is relative. One may be conscious of many things. Self-concious is when one is aware of the boundary between oneself and the environment. Group-concious is when one is aware of the boundary between ones group and the environment. External-concious is when one is aware of the boundary between a being in ones environment, and ones environment?

On the gradient scale of consciousness(as I define it), one is more conscious if:

- the boundary they can draw between themself and the environment is crisper
- the models they maintain of the mechanisms of each side of that boundary are more accurate

NOTE: Model maintenance may be a component of intelligence. It could be that higher consciousness enables higher intelligence and the two are being blurred here. I'm not sure. at a certain point it just becomes words that people came up with

NOTE 2: On Free Will: Free Will is an interesting concept. It would appear to mean the ability for us to be in complete control of ourselves. I do not think I am in complete control of myself. I do not know where my ideas come from. I do not control when I feel hungry, or sleepy, or tired. I heard an analogy somewhere that being alive, having will, is like riding a horse.  When riding a horse, you can direct it and nudge it in the right direction. You can tell the horse to run faster or slower. But you do not have complete control over the horse. The horse is an animal and it responds most often instinctually. The horse obeys the rules of nature, of its body. It may occasionally listen to the rider too.
