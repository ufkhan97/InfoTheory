# Incomplete Notes for Information Theory of Everything pt2

I may have made a false distinction for convenience between energy and position. Or I should say between energy and movement. 

They are one and the same. Energy IS that which can move â€” existence. That which can not move is nonexistence. 

We are all always moving through spacetime. Space and Time are one and the same. They merely appear different because of the nature of our experience. 

We EXPERIENCE a 4 dimensional reality. One where we are able to control our movements in 3dspace but not in 1dtime â€” in time we appear to move steadily forward. 

In fact our time experience is a result of the fact that we are â€˜entangledâ€™ with the other objects around us. We are all on the same wavelength, vibrating to the same rhythm, and so we are moving through time at the same rate as everything around us. 

If we stopped moving through time â€” if we stopped moving through any dimension â€” we would not exist. The only thing that can exist is that which MOVES. Kinetic Energy? 

Superposition is the idea that something can be in multiple places at once. This notion of â€˜at onceâ€™ reveals the error in our thinking â€” we think time is something which constrains us to be in a single place. But time and space are the same. They are one type of thing: axis, dimension. On a graph you have x and y, such are space and time. X and Y are no different from one another, merely depends on which way you are looking at the graph (x goes left right, y goes up down) but they behave the same way. 

So why do we experience space as manifestly different from time? It is because we are synchronized to the energy around us, we are vibrating to the same rhythm, along an axis. We call that axis time. Time itself may have multiple axis. IN fact, it must have at least two in order to be a wavelength: it must have an axis of length and an axis of height. Then it must also have a frequency. A wave is defined as such: frequency, amplitude, (and if a repeating wave) period. I will note that a repeating wave can be looked at as a circle which we travel along. By the way, in the time wavelength we could call length the time we experience as moving through and amplitude uncertainty?

Godel said the universe must be incomplete. This is the only way to be stable. If the circle was finished the universe would not be? I don't know maybe it would just start over. 

IF we vibrated at a different rhythm than the energy around us: what would happen? 

 structure for the universe:

Energy which moves. Finite energy can occupy finite locations. By moving and changing location, the universe of energy can occupy different states. 

The universe is the possibility space of all possible states of the energy. 

There are clumps of energy in the universe which vibrate at particular frequencies and have started vibrating at the same frequency as the energy around them. This energy has greater certainty than energy which does not vibrate at the same  frequency as other energy around it. 

BIG ASSUMPTION: The universe wants to return to a state of maximum certainty: pre-big bang when all energy was one. 

To do this, all energy needs to vibrate at the same frequency else it will never merge. 

GUESS IN THE DARK : Dark matter, dark energy, are these just clumps of energy vibrating at a different time/uncertainty frequency from us?

SO: if we call the Big Bang our root node and say this was the time when all energy was in a single location and was one then we can imagine the fracture of the energy as children of the root node. Specifically, each child is a different universe state. A universe state is the â€˜energy which movesâ€™ arrangement/structure. Different positions of energy are different states. 

Why does energy have to be that which moves? 

Because if it did not move there would be no way for it to be. Movement is the thing existence does. A stationary thing is nonexistent. You can not be stationary for but a moment because time (as we think about it) isnâ€™t real. Time is experienced. Time is just another axis. 

ARE YOU sure? No 

Then how can the universe have children states, isnâ€™t the arrangement/order of those states time? 

Perhaps then the idea of the Big Bang happening so long ago and the idea of â€˜startingâ€™ our universe is mistaken. Perhaps our universe always was the possibility of all possible states. Perhaps the energy is not â€˜uncertainâ€™, perhaps it could be in multiple places. Whatâ€™s the difference? 

Perhaps this notion of states is wrong? 

Perhaps energy CAN be in multiple locations relative to other energy. Perhaps the universe

How could energy be in multiple locations?

IF we have a hash table: then we say that a thing which we hash and place on the table goes to a bucket in the table. If we hash the same thing again it will go to the same bucket on the table. It only exists once on the table. This is efficient. The universe is also efficient. But is it efficient in the same way?

How do hash tables relate to the universe? 

(When people thought in balls they thought the universe was a ball. When people though in linked lists or snapshots or hash tables they thought the universe was a....) 

I DONT GET IT ðŸ˜„Â 

Recap:

Universe of Energy.

Energy is the magic jello of existence. Energy is that which moves. Energy is always moving through multiple dimensions. We can not see all these dimensions. 

Is all the movement occurring? Yes. All the states exist? while the energy is moving through them. When energy becomes â€˜entangledâ€™ perhaps it stops being able to move in all possible states, now that energy can only move in particular states? 

Imagine:

Nonexistence like a fluid. A perfectly still fluid. A pool filled with water. Existence is the ripples, the waves, the thing traveling through the fluid.

Possible Shape (Weaving Pattern) of the Fabric:

Spiral starting at the center with just one color/thread. As it spirals out, a second thread also appears within the spiral. The threads each have their own loops within them and also loop with each other like linked chains. The threads fray and each fray takes on a different color and get interwoven into increasing complexity. 

Why does a second thread appear? The first thread spirals in such a way that there is a gap between the layers of the spiral. That gap is filled by the second thread.
