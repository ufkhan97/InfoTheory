# Information Theory of Everything pt4 Intelligence

When life first began, it was likely just a sequence of atoms: a string of dna or rna (or something similar) which persisted in time. Some of those sequences were able to replicate because of the symmetrical structure the molecule implies. 

Evolution is the process through which natural selection takes place. Natural selection is the survival of the fittest. Fitness is how well adapted a living being is to its environment. 

If a living being is just a molecule and that molecule’s fitness is how well adapted it is to its environment, then what happens if the environment changes? The molecule’s fitness must also change. IF the environment change makes the conditions unfavorable then the being is more likely to die. 

Somewhere along the line the molecules gained the ability to respond to environment changes in a way which increased their ability to survive, or their fitness. This ability to change in order to increase the odds of survival is proportional to intelligence.

A more intelligent being is better able to position itself to survive. The best positioning, which leads to the highest rates of survival, is likely based on predicting future situations and positioning oneself based on those predictions. 

In the case where learning is the improvement of intelligence: learning is the improvement of one’s ability to predict. Learning occurs through one guessing if a certain thing would be the case and then checking if it actually is. If it is or it is not, as long as one checks then one gains information which helps it make better predictions. 

In school, we ask questions and receive answers from our teachers (ideally). This is a process of guessing and checking. A great teacher provides answers which are closest to reality. A bad teacher does not understand reality. 

The best teacher is likely reality itself. Maybe that’s why the best traders, who hone their ability to make predictions in line with reality, are geniuses.
