# Information

Information is that which resolves uncertainty. When you roll a six-sided die the outcome is uncertain. There are six possible outcomes. When the die finishes rolling and you see which side landed face-up then the uncertainty is resolved. But if you didn't see what side the die landed up —if it rolled under the couch for example — then the outcome would remain uncertain. You did not gain any information. When you see the die you receive information and you resolve uncertainty. 

Information is also that which is encoded in words, symbols, computer code, DNA, and other methods of communication. 

Information emerges from energy with position. Any energy with position can be encoding information so long as the code is known to an observer. More generally, any structure which can be distinguished from another can encode information. In the universe, as soon as energy was able to be distinguished from other energy then there was position, relation, and the possibility of information. 

There is no objective information, only subjective. Information is always relative to some observer. This is because uncertainty can only be resolved

Best way to visualize information is likely a wavelength. Something about lossless vs lossy compression. Try and understand the math.

Gravity is the pull of certainty? Uncertain energy is unstable?

Temperature is an increase in uncertainty?
